# 👋 Hey, I'm Yam

I work on **AI systems** - agents, retrieval, and graph-based reasoning.  
I focus on building small, practical tools that explore how these systems behave in real-world use cases.
I use GitHub as a place to test ideas, ship fast iterations, and learn in public.

## 🧩 Background
1. **AI Engineering** - agent workflows, retrieval, graph-structured reasoning  
2. **Data & Backend Engineering** - pipelines, APIs, and systems in Python/Kotlin  
3. **Jazz & Investing** - I have a serious background in both fields and often build tools that draw on them as real-world domains

## 🔧 Current Projects
- **WSB-Sentiment-Agent** - LLM-powered sentiment extraction  
- **Mental-Model-Mapper** — RAG based subjects mapper with analogies.
