# Hey, I'm Yam 👋

I’m a Data Engineer and Jazz Pianist from Israel, exploring the intersection between structure and creativity — both in music and in code.

## 🎹 From Jazz to Data Pipelines

I've been playing piano for nearly two decades, with over a decade immersed in jazz. That shaped how I think: listen deeply, build intentionally, leave space when it matters.

I bring that same mindset to engineering. I enjoy designing **data-intensive systems** that are expressive, reliable, and thoughtfully constructed — the kind of systems that *just make sense* when you read the code.

Right now, I’m building **[BirdLane](https://github.com/YOUR_REPO/BirdLane)** — a Kotlin-based data orchestration system inspired by jazz. It’s an attempt to bring flexibility and clarity into data workflows by blending structure with flow.

## ⚙️ My Current Stack

- **Languages:** Kotlin, Python, Java, SQL, JavaScript  
- **Backend Frameworks:** FastAPI, Flask  
- **Big Data & Databases:** Kafka, Spark, PostgreSQL, Redshift, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, DuckDB, Redis, S3  
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Prometheus, Grafana  
- **Data Tools & Analytics:** Pandas, Power BI  

## 🛠️ What I’m Into

- Building backend-heavy tools with a strong developer experience  
- Real-time, distributed data systems  
- Writing clean, idiomatic code that reflects its purpose  
- Learning deeply and building in public  

## 🎯 Why I Build

I want to create tools that help developers get into flow — the same way great musicians do.
