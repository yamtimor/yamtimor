I build **intelligent systems** that are agentic, graph-structured, and data-driven.

My work focuses on **how systems reason**:
- agents as graphs  
- signals as relationships  
- intelligence as structure, not prompts  

GitHub is where I turn mental models into systems.

## Approach
My perspective is shaped by two real-world domains:
- **Jazz**: real-time improvisation, constraint-based creativity, non-linear structure  
- **Markets**: signal extraction, second-order effects, decision-making under uncertainty  

I care less about models and more about **how intelligence behaves inside systems**.  
I enjoy building with people who bring different perspectives.

## Focus
- Agent systems & orchestration  
- Graph-based reasoning  
- Data & backend systems (Python, Kotlin)
