# Hey, I'm Yam 👋

I'm an AI Engineer focused on building reasoning-driven systems, data architectures, and backend foundations that scale.

I come from a strong background in data engineering, backend development, and analytics — giving me a hybrid edge when working on AI infrastructure and research-engineering projects.

I'm currently working on [wsb-sentinel-agent](https://github.com/yamtimor/wsb-sentinel-agent)

## Beyond Code
I'm also a jazz pianist — I bring the same mix of structure and improvisation to engineering.
