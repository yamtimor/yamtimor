# Hey, I'm Yam 👋

I'm a Backend & Data Engineer based in Israel — building high-quality tools for modern data workflows.

With 5+ years of experience across data engineering, backend development, and analytics, I focus on creating clean, scalable systems that solve real problems. I care deeply about developer experience, architecture clarity, and writing code that reflects intent.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

Right now, I'm building [**BirdLane**](https://github.com/yamtimor/BirdLane) — a Kotlin-based data orchestration tool that takes inspiration from music: expressive, composable, and structured. Think Airflow meets jazz.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Kotlin, Python, Java, SQL  
- **Frameworks:** FastAPI, Flask  
- **Data & Infra:** Kafka, Spark, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, DuckDB, S3  
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Prometheus, Grafana  
- **Tools:** Pandas, Power BI  

## 🎯 What Drives Me

- Building developer-first tooling in backend and data systems  
- Designing real-time, distributed architecture with clarity  
- Writing elegant, idiomatic Kotlin and Python  
- Exploring the potential of **Kotlin as a serious language for Data Engineering**  
- Sharing ideas and progress in public — to help and to grow  

## ✨ A Bit Extra

Outside of code, I’m a professional jazz pianist — 20 years at the keys.  
I bring the same mindset to engineering: fluidity, structure, and expression.
