# 👋 Hey, I'm Yam

I work on **AI systems** - agents, retrieval, and graph-based reasoning.  
I focus on building small, practical tools that explore how these systems behave in real-world use cases.
I use GitHub as a place to test ideas, ship fast iterations, and learn in public.

## 🧩 Background
1. **AI Engineering** - agent workflows, retrieval, graph-structured reasoning  
2. **Data & Backend Engineering** - pipelines, APIs, and systems in Python/Kotlin  
3. **Jazz & Investing** - I have a serious background in both fields and often build tools that draw on them as real-world domains

## 🔧 Current Projects
- **wsb-sentiment-agent** - LLM-powered sentiment extraction  
- **jazz-sna-agent** — A jazz-inspired Social Network Analysis agent that maps the deep structure of jazz history: nodes = musicians, edges = collaborations, filters = years/events — revealing hidden hubs & movements
- **BirdLane** - Soon...
